This is the repo for assignment 6 local weather assignment.

# Desription

This application was made to show the local weather and its 5 day forecast. By putting a city in the search bar you will be able to see the forecast at the moment and over the next 5 days.

For this project I used HTML and JS as my languages as well as bootstrap library 5.1.3. I used the open weather API: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 this project is hosted and deployed on Github.

Some of the challenges were writing a function to show 5 days of the forecast, leveraging bootstrap for a seamless UI and having local storage work in the manner I wanted.

# Usage

To leverage the project simply visit my repo at:https://github.com/mikededo58/local-weather.
